Known Issues so far:

A) There seems to be some empty space on the Left-hand and Right-hand side of the body area. Not sure what to put there.

B) The page does not extend all the way down to the bottom of the viewport.

C) The button's text is slightly hard to read. 

D) There is no on click redirection for the button yet. 

E) The index file (and all other web page files) are in html, not PHP yet. 
Because of this, we have unnecessary style files and functionality files. PHP should combine all three (HTML, CSS, and backend code) into one file when fixed.
