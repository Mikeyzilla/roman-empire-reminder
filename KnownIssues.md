Known Issues so far:

A) We need a signup implementation system. If the user is already signed up (i.e has an account) then when "Enlist now!" is clicked, instead of going to the signup page, they should go to the Main Page.
    -- Right now, I just made it so that the user defaults going to the sign up page (This assumes they do not have an account)

B) The thought bubbles in the Soldier Dialogue in Sign Up don't account for the varying texts (I have texts of different lengths that don't fit / look well)

C) Enlist now (For now) does not look great. 

D) Need to add an implementation in Sign Up, where depending on what the user has done, not only does the soldier dialogue text change, but once the user clicks on the stamp (the submit button), then SUBMIT appears. SUBMIT doesn't just stay on the screen right away.
