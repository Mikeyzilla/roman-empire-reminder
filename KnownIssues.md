Known Issues so far:

A) Need to add a link next to Enlist Now! for users who already have an account, that way they can skip the sign up process and go directly to the main page.
    -- Logout button needs server testing before saying it's 100% complete.
    -- Login Page needs server testing before saying it's 100% complete.
    -- Register needs server testing before it's 100% complete.
    -- Set reminder needs server testing.

B) Enlist now (For now) does not look great. 
    -- For now, I've changed it so that it goes directly to Set Reminder so I can design that page easier.

C) Style the Go Back Home button in Set Reminder better.

D) Need to update the login route to account for reminderSetAt.

E) Make sure enlist now goes directly to sign up when all of the above is done.
