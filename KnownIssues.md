Known Issues so far:

A) We need a signup implementation system. If the user is already signed up (i.e has an account) then when "Enlist now!" is clicked, instead of going to the signup page, they should go to the Main Page.

B) Instead of the text just appearing in front of each soldier's head, they should appear in the thought bubble image. The process is as follows: if the user hovers over the thought bubble location, then the corresponding thought bubble appears (away from the bubble location, still towards the head) with its corresponding bubble text depending on the point in conversation.
