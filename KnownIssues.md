Known Issues so far:

A) Need to add a link next to Enlist Now! for users who already have an account, that way they can skip the sign up process and go directly to the main page.
    -- Logout button needs server testing before saying it's 100% complete.
    -- Login Page needs server testing before saying it's 100% complete.
    -- Register needs server testing before it's 100% complete.
    -- Set reminder needs server testing.

B) Enlist now (For now) does not look great. 
    -- For now, I've changed it so that it goes directly to Set Reminder so I can design that page easier. However, in 
    -- Normal User Flow, Enlist now should go to sign up, and there should be a link to the right of Enlist that goes to Login.

C) Need a button to go from Set Reminder back to the main page.

D) Potentially add a page or clock on the main page that allows you to view the amount of time remaining on your reminder.

E) Need to update the login route to account for reminderSetAt.

F) In DisplayRomanEmpire, need to implement the rest of the logic following the defeated roman appearing.

G) In set reminder, update text instead of an alert.
