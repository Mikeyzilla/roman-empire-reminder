This is Mike! This Roman Empire app was designed to be a fun, educational way to remember the Roman Empire. It uses Tauri, SQLite3, React, and Node. I did have help coming up with the narrative scroll and some syntax using AI, but I made sure to test the code to make sure it worked and thoroughly reviewed and rebuilt it to understand what was going on in the areas that I needed help with. Whenever I did use AI, I also made sure to build muscle memory and rewrite it in a way that would work in my coding style.

In order to run this app, not only will you need to set up a proper SQLite3 DB that matches the fields it expects, but you will also need to connect to that DB in the server, add in CORS to the Server, as well as provide your own JWT secret code.
