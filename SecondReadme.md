This is Mike! This Roman Empire app was designed to be a fun, educational way to remember the Roman Empire. It uses Tauri, SQLite3, and Node. I did have help coming up with some of the syntax for this app using AI, but the idea is my own and when I did use AI, it was for help with the syntax - afterwards, I tested it to make sure it worked, rewrote the code to build muscle memory, and worked to fully understand what was going on.

In order to run this app, not only will you need to set up a proper SQLite3 DB that matches the fields it expects, but you will also need to connect to that DB in the server, add in CORS to the Server, as well as provide your own JWT secret code.
