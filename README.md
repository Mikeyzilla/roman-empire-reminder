# Roman Empire Reminder

Imperivm Romanvm magnus est.

## TODO:

- Figure out how to send push notifications, apparently we'll need Firebase integration because neither Tauri nor Android (?) support it natively.

- Make (really) attractive and engaging UI

- Make SQLite database in backend to count the streak for number of days straight the user has thought about the Roman Empire.  The count goes up when the user clicks on a button on the center of the screen or "yes" on a push notification.

## Plausible ideas:

- Maybe make the app multilingual for greater reach

- Maybe add some chat functionality to keep the jokes going and create a community

- Maybe include a daily multiple-choice question about the Roman Empire so that the app isn't totally useless and actually teaches something.
